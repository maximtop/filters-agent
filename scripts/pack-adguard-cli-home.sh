# Pack an activated AdGuard CLI home into the seed archive and prove the packed copy still holds an
# active licence. Called by seed-adguard-cli-home.sh after activating; run on its own, it slims an
# existing seed without activating another licence device. The AdGuard CLI blocker module ships
# both scripts for its setup action's seed mode.
#
# The archive stays under 500 KiB so it fits every channel a seed travels through, including a
# BuildKit secret, which BuildKit refuses over that size. The filter databases (`agflm_*.db`,
# ~53 MB) are what pushes a home past that; the CLI rebuilds them on its first command, so they
# stay out along with the logs.
