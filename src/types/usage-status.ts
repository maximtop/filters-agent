/**
 * The usage-accounting honesty vocabularies, declared once for the whole codebase: how completely a
 * run's provider replies reported usage, how much of it could be priced, and the two campaign-era
 * spellings of the same two questions.
 *
 * Both eras live here TOGETHER rather than merged, and the merge is not available: each spelling is
 * pinned by an artifact already on disk. `costCoverage`/`usageCompleteness` are persisted fields of
 * the v2 run usage summary (`RunUsageSummarySchema`), and `costStatus`/`telemetryHealth` are
 * persisted fields of every campaign artifact — including pre-migration ones, which is also why
 * `CostStatus` keeps the `Reported` and `Mixed` members pi can no longer produce (see
 * `campaign-cost-status.ts`). Renaming either set to the other's literals stops one of the two
 * formats parsing.
 *
 * What the merge would have removed is here instead: the correspondence between the two eras is
 * stated once, as the two tables below, so no consumer re-derives it and no module grows a private
 * mapper whose name collides with a different function of the same name.
