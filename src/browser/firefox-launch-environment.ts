/**
 * What one Firefox launch needs of its own before the browser starts: a home directory the process
 * user owns, and the sandbox facts that explain what the browser will say about its own sandbox.
 *
 * Firefox refuses to start as root under a foreign-owned `$HOME`: the container action's `HOME` is
 * the runner's mounted home (`/github/home`, uid 1001), and every launch of the first live uBO run
 * died with "Running Nightly as root in a regular user's session is not supported. ($HOME is
 * /github/home which is owned by uid 1001.)". The check compares the _owner_ of `$HOME` against the
 * effective uid, so the fix is a home the launching process owns — not a different uid, not a
 * disabled check. A per-launch temporary directory is the smallest thing that satisfies it, and it
 * also keeps the browser's own profile leftovers out of a shared home.
