 * was installed into the operator's user trust domain, and on macOS the whole user keychain domain
 * — including that trust domain — is resolved from `HOME`. Pointing it at an empty private
 * directory therefore hides exactly the trust the route depends on, and every intercepted
 * navigation fails as an unknown authority. `XDG_*` carries the isolation instead, and the profile
 * itself is isolated by its own user data directory. The temporary directory is the one exception
 * to route ownership: Chromium binds its ProcessSingleton socket under `$TMPDIR` beneath a 108-byte
 * `sun_path` CHECK, which the deep route-owned path overflows, so the browser gets a short private
 * temp dir instead (see `strict-route-temp-dir.ts`).
