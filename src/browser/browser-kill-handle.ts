/**
 * The kill handle every browser launch keeps: the pid of Playwright's own browser process.
 *
 * A close on a wedged page can block in the protocol forever, and the escalation after the close
 * deadline is only as good as what it has to kill. The first live runs proved the gap: the forced
 * kill reported "no session-owned profile path: this browser cannot be force-killed" and
 * `killedProcesses: 0`, because the only kill route was a `/proc` command-line scan for a
 * session-unique profile path — which a plain `launch()` never has (Playwright picks its own
 * temporary profile and never tells the caller where). 35 s per session were spent waiting for a
 * kill that could not happen.
 *
 * Playwright publishes no process accessor on `Browser` (only `BrowserServer.process()`, which
 * belongs to the `launchServer` route this repo does not take), so the pid comes from the
 * in-process client-to-server bridge every local `playwright-core` connection carries. It is an
 * internal seam by necessity: reached defensively, logged when it is not there, and never required
 * for a launch to succeed.
