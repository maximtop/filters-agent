 * Playwright Firefox engine and the enterprise-policies channel, whose managed storage carries the
 * current content of the run's user-filters file. The two channels are exclusive by construction
 * here, which is what keeps `BrowserSession.create` from ever seeing a mixed configuration.
 *
 * The policies are rebuilt on every launch rather than stored: Firefox reads `policies.json` only
 * at startup, so the content a session serves is exactly the content the file held when that
 * session was launched.
