/**
 * Revision-marked report posting of the Publisher.
 *
 * One short report comment per issue carries a hidden revision marker on its first line: the marker
 * binds the comment to one immutable issue revision digest, so a repeated run on the same revision
 * reports `already_reported` without a write while a new revision posts a new report. Existing
 * comments count for dedupe only when their body parses to exactly one valid marker — a malformed,
 * duplicated, or invalid-digest marker is ignored for dedupe and can never block posting or throw.
 *
 * This module performs platform writes only; the comment content itself is rendered by
 * `report-render.ts`, so untrusted model-authored text never reaches a marker position.
 *
 * A marker only counts when it was authored by the run's own identity (see
 * `github/report-author-identity.ts`): on a public repository, anyone can post a comment shaped
 * like the hidden marker, and without an author check that forged comment would be trusted exactly
 * like a real prior report.
