/**
 * Version-update decision of the Publisher.
 *
 * A small pure comparison between the blocker version the report declares (`Report` →
 * `environment.version`, verbatim) and the executor version the run actually observed — the same
 * value the report's `{{executorVersion}}` fill names. When the reported version is strictly older
 * and the run observed the reported symptom absent (`SymptomObservation.NotReproduced`), the report
 * suggests updating instead of fixing: the problem is most likely already fixed in the current
 * build. Every other combination — reproduced symptom, missing or unparseable versions, an
 * indeterminate observation — decides to no suggestion, and the report stays exactly as it is.
 *
 * The comparator is deliberately conservative: dotted-numeric versions only. Free-form tags
 * (`nightly`, `MV2`/`MV3` labels, prerelease names) are incomparable and never suggest an update —
 * under-suggestion is safe, a false suggestion is the failure mode to guard against. An
 * incomparable version never fails the report; it only leaves it without a hint.
