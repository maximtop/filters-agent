/**
 * Report rendering of the Publisher.
 *
 * One run outcome is turned into the fixed fill record every report template renders against (see
 * `report-template.ts`), with model-authored text escaped, flattened to one line, and bounded by
 * the shared untrusted-text machinery (see `untrusted-text.ts`) so a verbose or hostile run can
 * never break the comment structure. Comment bodies on GitHub sanitize most HTML, but the escape is
 * defense in depth: one reader-dependent renderer decides what `{{tokens}}` in a template become.
 * The `rule` fill is repository content rather than model prose, and renders through the same
 * module's inline-code-span renderer instead: Markdown reads a rule's own syntax (`*.../*`, say) as
 * formatting unless the whole value stays inside a code span.
