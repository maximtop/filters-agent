/**
 * The report's "place in the list" reading: the file an accepted rule goes into and, when the host

 *
 * The run plans the exact edit — the domain list it extends, the sorted position, the site's own
 * block, the end of a section — and the issue comment used to name the file alone. On the EasyList
 * fork that read as "easylist/easylist_specific_hide.txt" for a rule the run had placed between two
 * specific lines of a 8,800-rule sorted list, which is the part a maintainer would otherwise have
 * to redo by hand. The position is named by the rule it precedes, never by a line number: a line
 * number drifts between the run and the moment someone reads the comment, the neighbouring rule
 * does not.
