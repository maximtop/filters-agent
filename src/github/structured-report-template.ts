/**
 * Section headings of the issue form that AdGuard's intake bot relays into every user report.
 *
 * The bot renders all reports from one fixed template, so the presence of these headings is what
 * separates a complete structured report from ordinary discussion. Live intake, automatic upstream
 * sync, and the trusted-evidence gate in `prompt-safety.ts` each answer that same question, and
 * before this table each spelled the headings independently — a reworded template silently agreed
 * with only some of them. The spellings live here so one template change is one edit.
 *
 * Every pattern is line-anchored (`m`), case-insensitive because the bot's Markdown is not
 * normalized, and `u` because report bodies carry arbitrary Unicode. None carries `g`, so the
 * shared instances hold no `lastIndex` state between callers.
