/**
 * Agent session runner: the one seam the rest of the codebase talks to. Given a system prompt text,
 * a tool set, and the mode's terminal tool, it builds a pi agent session, runs one user task, and
 * returns a sealed Terminal Outcome. Every pi type is hidden behind this module; the runner never
 * throws for model/provider behavior — every ending seals as a typed outcome.
 *
 * The runner owns the tool-call observation boundary: it attaches `tool-bounce.ts` ONCE PER RUN in
 * `runAgentSession` — established before the first prompt and unsubscribed in the run's `finally`,
 * so the observation spans both prompt phases of the nudge flow. That attachment feeds the terminal
 * tool's rejection cap from pi's own tool events (pre-`execute` schema bounces and execute-thrown
 * rejections alike) and reports every call pi refused before `execute` to `onToolBounce`, which is
 * the only way such a call reaches the run evidence at all.
 *
 * Sealing paths: terminal acceptance, the rejection cap, the nudge-exhausted no-terminal diagnosis,
 * provider-failure after the configured retry bounds (or immediately for a non-transient message),
 * budget-exceeded from the wall-clock, iteration or per-request guards, and caller abort (mid-run
 * or before the run started). The two-phase nudge flow and the sealed-outcome vocabulary live in
 * `run-sealing.ts`, the turn-end and compaction observation and the run's usage report in
 * `session-telemetry.ts`, and the guards that stop a run in `run-guards.ts`. `mode-session.ts`
 * supplies the production prompt texts, budgets and retry values per mode.

 *
 * Three consequences of running retries through pi rather than through the deleted loop's own
 * transport, none of which the bounds themselves show:
 *
 * - Transience is pi's MESSAGE-based classification, not an HTTP status: it matches the composed
 *   `"<status>: <body>"` text against a substring/regex list (`overloaded`, `429`, `5xx`,
 *   `timeout`, `terminated`, `fetch failed`, `socket hang up`, …) and fails fast on quota/billing
 *   wording. Transport and timeout failures are covered by that list, but the match is textual, so
 *   a body that merely CONTAINS `500` classifies as transient. It is also incomplete for a gateway
 *   behind Cloudflare — the origin-side 52x/530 range is absent from it, so `runAgentSession`
 *   extends the session's decision through `transient-gateway-retry.ts`, within these same bounds.
 *   Single-shot calls do not use this path at all: they pass `maxRetries` into pi-ai's own
 *   status-based transport retry (408/409/429/5xx), which the agent loop leaves disabled — that one
 *   covers the whole 5xx range and therefore needs no extension. One gateway, two classifiers.
 * - Every retried attempt is a fresh agent run, so it emits its own `turn_end`: a transient failure
 *   consumes one of `RunBudgets.maxTurns` and is counted as a completion in the usage report, where
 *   the legacy loop's retries were invisible to `maxIterations`.
 * - There is no per-tool failure budget any more. The legacy loop ended a run after three tool
 *   failures without an intervening success and told the model how much budget was left; pi has no
 *   equivalent, and only the terminal tool's rejection cap survives.
