/**
 * Configuration→pi wiring: the two mappings from the validated `llm` configuration slice onto pi's
 * factories that every mode, runner and evaluator needs — the runtime handle and the out-of-loop
 * single-shot client, metered when the run collects usage. Both were open-coded at every call site
 * (five vision clients, ten runtimes), so a change to the retry derivation or the runtime fields
 * had to be repeated to stay consistent. The injection seams stay with the callers: a site that
 * accepts an injected runtime or vision client still resolves its own `dependencies.*` first and
 * only calls these helpers for the default. An injected client is then used exactly as given:
 * metering belongs to the client this module builds, and re-wrapping a caller's own metered client
 * would count its completions twice.
