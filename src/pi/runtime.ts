 * Pi runtime setup: turn application provider configuration into a ready pi model runtime — the

 * credentials held in an in-memory store, both model handles resolved, compatibility flags
 * applied.
 *
 * One gateway, but TWO provider registrations — one per ROLE — because a pi provider catalog holds
 * one entry per model ID and pi resolves a handle by `getModels(provider).find(m => m.id === id)`
 * (`pi-ai`'s `models.js`). The two roles are registered with deliberately different capabilities:
 * the reasoning entry is `input: ['text']`, the vision entry `input: ['text', 'image']`. Put both
 * in one catalog and a configuration that names the SAME slug for both roles collapses onto
 * whichever entry was registered first — the text-only one — and pi's message transform then strips
 * every image before the request with `(image omitted: model does not support images)`. A live run
 * with `llmModel` and `llmVisionModel` both set to `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` answered every
 * `analyze_screenshot` call with "No image was delivered with this request" for exactly that
 * reason. A provider id per role gives each its own slot, so the two handles stay distinct no
 * matter how the ids compare — one slug serving both roles is a supported configuration, not a
 * collision.

 * host is not `deepseek.com` — so the flag must be explicit, and it only takes effect on entries
 * registered with `reasoning: true`.
 *
 * `sendSessionAffinityHeaders` with `sessionAffinityFormat: 'openai'` attaches `session_id`,

 * (`deepseek.com`, `cerebras.ai`, …) — the gateway host is none of them, so the detected default is
 * `true`. The gateway's upstream pool is not uniform on that role: in one live campaign a replica
 * answered 400 "messages[0].role: unknown variant developer, expected one of system, user,
 * assistant, tool" on the 26th request of a session whose first 25 requests — same model, same
 * system prompt, same role — had been accepted by other replicas, and the run sealed
