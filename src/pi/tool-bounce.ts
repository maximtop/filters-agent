/**
 * Tool-call observation: the ONE place a tool call the model made is matched with how it ended.
 *
 * Two things depend on seeing a call pi refused BEFORE `execute` — a schema bounce against the
 * advertised parameters, a blocked or unknown tool, a call on a message truncated by the output
 * limit. Such a call reaches no wrapper this codebase installs, so:
 *
 * - The terminal tool's rejection cap is fed from here, because counting inside `execute` would miss
 *   every pre-`execute` bounce and leave a schema-invalid submission loop unbounded; and
 * - The bounce itself is RECORDED from here, because the execute wrapper never sees it. Without this,
 *   the exact benchmark failure the streak cap was relaxed for — a summary 39 characters over its
 *   limit, resubmitted until the run sealed — was visible in the run evidence only as a tool name
 *   on the turn event, with neither the payload nor pi's reason anywhere.
 *
 * The two are told apart by `markExecuted`, which the runner's pi tool adapter calls with the call
 * id the moment `execute` runs: an id the observation never saw marked is a call that never
 * executed. Anything else would double-record, since the execute wrapper already writes its own
 * tool_call/tool_result pair for a rejection it threw.
 */

/**
 * The payload pi echoes back at the end of its validation message.
 *
 * Pi composes a bounce as `Validation failed for tool "x":\n - <path>: <message>\n\nReceived
 * arguments:\n<pretty-printed arguments>` (pi-ai `utils/validation.js`), and the echoed arguments
 * are the whole submission — a fix outcome with its reasoning and summary. Two things break if that
 * block travels on as the reason: the same-reason streak can then only trip on a byte-identical
 * resubmission, so a model shortening its summary by one character each time never repeats a
 * "reason" and only the total ceiling ever fires; and the reason is persisted (the seal's
 * `lastReason`, the fix host summary, the analysis-only fallback reasoning, campaign reports),
 * where a whole payload is not a reason. The per-path issue lines are kept, which is the same shape
 * `formatIssues` gives the execute path, so the two bounce paths compare and read alike.
