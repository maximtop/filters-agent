/**

 * first call's fingerprint before its observation read it. Sequential execution makes execute →
 * observe strictly ordered per call, which is the invariant the slot relies on.
 */
const TERMINAL_EXECUTION_MODE: ToolExecutionMode = 'sequential';

/**
 * The terminal tool: the single finishing convention of a pi agent session. One mode, one tool.
 * Submissions face two depths of the same contract: pi pre-validates the raw arguments against the
 * advertised schema — the mode's Valibot schema converted verbatim — BEFORE execute runs and
 * bounces violations with its own error text; execute re-validates with Valibot, which is what
 * gives the handler typed input and what a caller invoking execute without pi in front of it relies
 * on, and then runs the optional host-side hook, throwing its rejection reason, which pi returns to
 * the model as a tool error. Either way the model sees the reason and retries in the same session
 * with full context.
 *
 * Rejection counting lives at exactly ONE place — `observeRejection` below, fed by the runner from
 * the session's `tool_execution_end` error events, which both bounce paths surface through.
 * Counting inside execute would miss every pre-`execute` validation bounce and leave a
 * schema-invalid submission loop unbounded. Two DIFFERENT values are kept, because the cap and the
 * sealed outcome ask different questions: `rejections` is the total number of rejected submissions
 * of the run (what the outcome reports, and what an operator reading a seal expects), while
 * `repeatedRejections` is the length of the current same-reason streak (what the cap compares
 * against `maxRejections`). Collapsing them into one counter — the streak, reported as the total —
 * made a run that failed three different ways seal claiming a single rejection. The cap counts
 * REPEATED rejections: a reason the model has not seen before resets the streak, because a model
 * that changes its answer is still working the problem, while one that resubmits into the same wall
 * is stuck. Both counters are bounded: the streak by `maxRejections`, the total by the wider
 * ceiling `TERMINAL_REJECTION_TOTAL_MULTIPLE` derives from it, so a model alternating between two
 * walls forever — which never builds a streak — still seals as rejected-terminal with its last
 * reason instead of draining the turn budget into a budget-exceeded seal that carries no reason at
 * all. Acceptance settles the run with the validated payload.
 *
 * The simplified knowledge-base pattern (plain cap, no forced-tool-choice reserved turn) is kept,
 * with progress awareness restored after a benchmark run showed the plain cap sealing a healthy
 * run: a summary 39 characters over its limit was shortened on every retry (439 -> 425 -> 416) and
 * still ran out of budget, because a model cannot count characters exactly.
 *
 * What makes two rejections "the same" is the host's business. A host hook may hand back a
 * fingerprint beside the model-facing reason, and the streak then compares fingerprints; a host
 * that gives none, and every pre-`execute` schema bounce, is compared by reason text. The
 * distinction exists because the text of a rejection can stay word-for-word identical while the
 * model does exactly the browser work it asks for: live run 34003130266 sealed four fix runs after
 * three same-text rejections whose progress counters had moved between them.
 */

/**
 * Default cap on CONSECUTIVE identical rejections before the run seals as rejected-terminal.
 *
 * Every rejection returns the full validation reasons to the model, so three submissions that hit
 * the same wall are pathological rather than unlucky. A different reason means the model moved, so
 * the streak starts over and the run is not sealed while it is still converging; the total
 * rejection count keeps rising across those resets and is bounded only by the wider ceiling
 * `TERMINAL_REJECTION_TOTAL_MULTIPLE` derives.

 * case untouched — the benchmark run this cap was relaxed for needed three distinct reasons (439 ->
 * 425 -> 416 characters) and a converging model runs out of distinct reasons quickly — while
 * bounding the alternating one at a small multiple of the budget a stuck model already gets. It
 * scales with `maxRejections`, so a mode that tightens the streak cap tightens the ceiling too.
