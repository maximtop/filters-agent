/**
 * The gaps this seam closes in pi's in-run retry classification: transient failures of the gateway
 * path that pi does not recognize as transient, and therefore never retries.
 *
 * Pi classifies a failed turn from the composed error MESSAGE against a fixed list of substrings
 * (`RETRYABLE_PROVIDER_ERROR_PATTERN` in `pi-ai`'s `dist/utils/retry.js`), so wording it did not
 * enumerate is simply not transient to it — and none of the `retry` settings pi exposes (`enabled`,
 * `maxRetries`, `baseDelayMs`, `provider.timeoutMs`) carries a predicate, a pattern, or a status
 * list. There is no supported hook; extending the decision means reaching into the session object
 * pi hands back.
 *
 * Two shapes are covered, each of them a live campaign run that lost a case to one hiccup: a
 * Cloudflare origin status ahead of the message, and a transport-level stream fault the gateway
 * relays from its upstream as prose. The patterns below carry their own evidence.
 *
 * `extendTransientGatewayRetry` is that reach, kept to one wrapped method in one module so the
 * whole vendor coupling is visible in one place when the pin moves.

/**
 * Leading HTTP status of a Cloudflare origin-side failure, as pi-ai composes a provider error for
 * the `openai-completions` API this runtime registers.
 *
 * The gateway this runtime talks to sits behind Cloudflare, and Cloudflare answers an origin-side
 * fault with its own 52x/530 range rather than the origin's status.
 *
 * Why this set — 520 through 527, plus 530: pi-ai's own `RETRYABLE_PROVIDER_ERROR_PATTERN`
 * (`dist/utils/retry.js` of the pinned 0.84.1) enumerates transient HTTP statuses one literal at a
 * time — `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504`, `524` — and stops there. Cloudflare's origin-side range
 * is 520-527 and 530, of which only 524 (a gateway timeout) made pi's list. A live campaign run was
 * answered `520 status code (no body)` on one loop request; pi read the message, found nothing it
 * recognized, ended the turn in error, and the run sealed `provider-failure` after that single
 * attempt — one whole case spent on one edge hiccup that the deleted status-based loop retried as
 * an ordinary 5xx. 524 is kept in the range deliberately: the set means "Cloudflare answered for
 * the origin", and pi already retrying one member of it is not a reason to spell the range with a
 * hole.
 *
 * Why anchored at the start: that is where the status lands. For this API pi-ai's
 * `formatProviderError` composes `"<status>: <body>"` with NO provider prefix (the same structural
 * fact `isDeterministicProviderMessage` reads in `run-sealing.ts`), and when the response carries
 * no body at all the OpenAI SDK's own message is `"<status> status code (no body)"` — the exact
 * text the campaign saw. Anchoring is what keeps a token count, an id or a byte size quoted inside
 * a body from being read as a gateway status.

/**
 * Wording of a transport-level stream fault an OpenAI-compatible gateway relays from its upstream,
 * anywhere in the composed message.
 *
 * Why this shape at all — a live campaign run was answered, at loop turn 51, with `Upstream error
 * from Together: Stream error: h2 protocol error: error reading a body from connection`. There is
 * no HTTP status in it: the gateway accepted the request, answered 200, and then faulted
 * mid-stream, so the OpenAI SDK composes the message from the in-stream error chunk alone and the
 * status-based pattern above cannot see it. None of pi's substrings match it either — its nearest
 * entries are `connection.?error`, `connection.?lost` and `terminated`, and this text spells the
 * connection failure the other way round. Pi ended the turn in error, the run sealed
 * `provider-failure` after that single attempt, and 15 minutes of investigation went with it.
 *
 * Why these three phrases and nothing wider:
 *
 * - `stream error` — the gateway's own label for "the upstream stream broke", the part that is
 *   independent of which upstream and which protocol failed.
 * - `h2 protocol error` — HTTP/2 framing between gateway and upstream, a hop this run does not
 *   control and cannot influence by changing the request.
 * - `error reading a body from connection` — the body-read failure itself, the phrase pi's
 *   `connection.?error` just misses.
 *
 * Every one of them names a hop that broke while carrying a request the gateway had already
 * accepted, which is the definition of worth retrying: the same request sent again reaches a
 * different replica. None of them can be produced by the content of a request, so no deterministic
 * rejection is swept in — that is the whole reason the pattern enumerates phrases instead of
 * matching a bare `stream` or `protocol`. Word-bounded and unanchored: the prose arrives behind a
 * gateway prefix (`Upstream error from <vendor>:`) that no pattern should have to predict, and the
 * bounds keep a phrase from matching inside a longer word.
