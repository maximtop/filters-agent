/**
 * Telemetry of one agent session run: the turn-end and compaction observation seams feeding trace
 * recording, the live usage accumulation both of them write into, and the once-per-run usage report
 * built from it. Split out of `session-runner.ts` so the runner keeps session construction, guards
 * and sealing; the runner is this module's only caller.
 *
 * The usage report is ACCUMULATED, never reconstructed from `session.messages`, because compaction
 * is enabled: once pi rewrites the transcript into a summary, every pre-compaction assistant
 * message is gone from session state, and a seal-time scan of it would silently under-report a
 * compacted run as a handful of unreported completions. Every provider request instead lands here
 * the moment it completes — one completion per `turn_end`, plus one per compaction for the
 * summarization call pi paid for — so a compacted run still accounts for exactly what it spent.
 *
 * Both observers are non-fatal by design — a trace or usage sink must never break a run it only
 * watches — but a swallowed failure used to leave nothing behind at all: every failure is logged
 * with its observer context through the injected logger. It does NOT change what the turn reports:
 * a trace-recording failure is not a usage failure, the provider's counts are in hand either way,
 * and `usageCompleteness: partial` means one thing only — the provider sent no usage chunk.
