/**
 * Advertisement conversion of one tool's Valibot parameter schema: the JSON Schema pi registers as
 * the tool's parameters, advertises to the model, and pre-validates every call against.
 *
 * There is no node projection here any more, and that is the point. pi validates a tool call by
 * compiling the advertised schema with TypeBox (`Compile` + `Value.Check` inside pi-ai's
 * `validateToolArguments`), which is a JSON Schema validator: `minLength`, `maxLength`, `minimum`,
 * `maximum`, `pattern`, `enum`, `const`, `minItems`, `maxItems`, `anyOf`/`oneOf`, `required`,
 * `additionalProperties` and `$ref`/`$defs` are all compiled and enforced natively. Dropping the
 * bound keywords and re-rendering them as a prose "Constraints:" sentence bought nothing and cost
 * the model a machine-checkable contract.
 *
 * The one invariant this seam owes is that pi's pre-execute check must never be STRICTER than the
 * adapter's authoritative Valibot re-check, and `toJsonSchema` gives that for free:
 * `@valibot/to-json-schema` throws on any schema or action it cannot convert (its `errorMode`
 * defaults to `throw`), so every keyword it emits is a faithful projection of a Valibot action the
 * re-check enforces too. Unknown-key handling follows from the same rule rather than from a special
 * case: a plain `v.object` emits no `additionalProperties` and keeps stripping unknown keys on both
 * sides, while `v.strictObject` emits `false` and rejects them on both sides.
 *
 * Nor is pi's own bounce a lost failure path: `tool-bounce.ts` counts pi's pre-execute rejections
 * through `tool_execution_end` — which is how the terminal tool caps a model that keeps
 * resubmitting an invalid payload — and records each one, with the submitted arguments and pi's
 * reason, into the run trace.
