/**
 * Single-shot LLM calls on the pi runtime: every out-of-loop completion (vision verdicts,
 * inventories, screenshot analysis, benchmark reviewer, golden oracle) runs through this module.
 * One structured mechanism — prompt-and-parse with one bounded repair attempt, ported verbatim in
 * semantics from the retired vision-json adapter — serves them all, and the free-text path is the
 * same mechanism with no schema. Model/provider behavior never throws here: results are typed
 * unions, terminal failures emit one structured pino warn through the injected logger (pi exposes
 * no retry events, so this line is the only failure diagnostic a run sees), and programmer errors
 * still throw. This module is also the single-shot boundary between pi's vocabulary and the
 * application's own: pi's `Usage` and `StopReason` are mapped here into the shared
 * `CompletionUsage` and `TurnStopReason`, so nothing a consumer of these results touches is a
 * harness type.
 *
 * The contract types live in `single-shot-types.ts` and are imported FROM there by every consumer;
 * this module re-exports none of them. It used to, next to the behavior, and the result was two
 * reachable origins for one symbol — the split leaked into call sites either way, and one origin
 * per name is the property worth keeping. One bounded provider completion — the pi request mapping
 * and the inactivity deadline over the streamed response — is `single-shot-completion.ts`, which
 * every attempt made here goes through.
