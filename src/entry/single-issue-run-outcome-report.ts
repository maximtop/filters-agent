/**
 * Which sealed outcomes of the default single-issue engine are posted, and the short report of one
 * that never reached a locked `FixRunResult` — a skip, or a failure once the run's revision digest
 * was already computed — rendered for the artifacts.
 *
 * Only a finding a maintainer can act on is posted. A skip, an intake or investigation failure
 * (whose reason is the raw provider or runtime error, not anything about the issue), and a sealed
 * run that could not investigate the report post nothing: their report lands in the artifacts and
 * the log names the outcome. Without a posted comment such an issue carries no revision marker, so
 * in backlog mode the next backlog run retakes it. Also carries the shared "log the caught error in
 * full before mapping or swallowing it" helper every catch in the default single-issue engine
 * uses.
