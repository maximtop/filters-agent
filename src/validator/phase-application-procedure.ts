/**
 * The application the host runs between two environment phases.
 *
 * Decision 1 of 11-HITL: the application's steps are performed once over the phase lease, while the
 * host reads the blocker state back itself and credits the phase only when that state contains
 * exactly what the goal expects. A missing application or verification section is a recorded
 * refusal before any step runs — nothing here invents a way to apply a rule — and the action log is
 * assembled by the host from what it recorded, never from a model's self-report.
 *
 * Who performs the steps is the runner's business, not this procedure's: an instruction that writes
 * its own `## Rule application` gets a bounded model session, while the built-in AdGuard route is
 * performed by the host in code. This procedure is identical either way, which is what keeps the
 * two paths crediting by one rule.
 *
 * The credit itself lives in `blocker-state-credit.ts`, shared with the host-performed file-backed
 * application (31-AFK Decision 3), so every application path judges a read-back by one rule.
