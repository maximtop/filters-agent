/**
 * The review's symptom scope, composed on the host from reporter material the run holds
 * independently of any one candidate.
 *
 * The candidate visual review used to be handed whatever the reasoning model wrote in
 * `apply_rule`'s `symptomDescription`, and a model writes that description to fit the candidate it
 * just built. Two live runs show what that costs. On sitepoint.com (maximtop/easylist #1) the
 * reporter wrote "Visible ads in header, throughout article, in sidebar, and in footer"; the
 * candidate covered the in-article, sidebar and footer units, the scope handed to the review named
 * only those three, and the header banner that is still in the AFTER capture was never looked for —
 * the review returned `verified` with zero remaining instances. On nottinghampost.com
 * (maximtop/AdguardFilters #7) the scope was narrowed to "the band at the very top of the page
 * above the site header", so the identical empty placeholder bands between the page's other
 * sections did not count either.
 *
 * The review's own rules already say the opposite — "The reporter screenshot is an example of a
 * symptom that may repeat", "An AFTER observation that visually repeats the reporter-defined
 * symptom anywhere on the page must be remaining" — they simply never got a chance, because the
 * text defining the symptom was already narrowed to the candidate. So the host composes the scope
 * instead: the reporter's material leads, and the model's per-candidate description follows as what
 * this one candidate targets rather than as the whole symptom.
 *
 * This module is pure text composition and deliberately depends on nothing: it takes plain strings,
 * and the caller owns where they came from.
