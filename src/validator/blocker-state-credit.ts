/**
 * The one credit rule of an application: how the host judges the blocker state it read back.
 *
 * Decision 1 of 11-HITL fixed what an application may claim — the candidate is credited only when
 * the state carries exactly the candidate rule, the baseline only when it carries no user rule at
 * all, and both only when the enabled filter set the read-back can observe still equals the
 * prepared one. Decision 3 of 31-AFK added a second application path (the host's own file-backed
 * application, with no model session at all), so the judgment lives here rather than inside either
 * path: both credit by one rule, and a state that would fail in one can never pass in the other.
