/**
 * The preparation stage as a short-lived mode session.
 *
 * Decision (a) of the issue plan: when the run instruction carries a `## Preparation` section, the
 * host performs nothing — the model performs the blocker steps in this one session, bounded to the
 * two step tools of `preparation-tools.ts` and sealed by the `finish_preparation` terminal. The
 * session reuses the shared launch procedure (`launchModeSession`) with the same recorder and usage
 * collector the fix run already owns, so every preparation turn lands in the run trace; the trace
 * is deliberately left unsealed, because the fix run that follows owns the seal.
 *
 * The step-failure latch is the phase's verdict mechanism: a first non-zero (or timed-out) step
 * latches the shared gate, the two step tools refuse everything afterwards, a `done` payload is
 * rejected with user-shaped guidance while the latch holds, and the only accepted payload is
 * `status: failed`. The wall-clock budget `PREPARATION_PHASE_BUDGET_MS` bounds the whole phase; a
 * budget that expires seals the phase as the typed failed status with the guard's detail.
