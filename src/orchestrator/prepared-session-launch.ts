/**
 * How a run launches browser sessions for its one prepared extension build.
 *
 * Decision 2 of 31-AFK: the engine, the user-agent family and the extension channel all follow the
 * build's launch family, and a Firefox family needs two things no Chromium launch does — the
 * current content of the declared user-filters file in its enterprise policies, and a relaunch
 * whenever that content changes, because Firefox reads `policies.json` only at startup. The runtime
 * holds none of that logic itself: it hands this module the leaf options it needs
 * (`PreparedSessionLaunchHost`) and calls these functions, so the family knowledge lives in one
 * place beside the channel builder it delegates to.
