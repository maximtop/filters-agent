 * to follow the evidence, not the prose: a rejection's text is word-for-word identical whether or
 * not the model did the browser work it asks for in between. Live run 34003130266 sealed four fix
 * runs after three same-text rejections although the model had closed its session, launched a fresh
 * `reported_on_current` one and revalidated the candidate between every two of them. What changes
 * when the model makes progress is the requirement's counters and statuses; what changes when it
 * merely repeats itself is session ids, ordinals and artifact ids. The fingerprint keeps the former
 * and drops the latter along with every prose field, so equal fingerprints mean equal progress.
 * This is the retired agent loop's finish-retry identity, ported unchanged.
