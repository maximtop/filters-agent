/**
 * The host-side extension preparation a fix run performs before its fix session starts.
 *
 * Decision (a) of the issue plan, in order:
 *
 * 1. The instruction carries a `## Preparation` section — a short-lived preparation session performs
 *    the blocker steps and names its result; the payload's extension directory is validated to
 *    resolve inside the session workdir and to hold a loadable manifest. Provenance `Instruction`.
 * 2. No instruction, or none with the section — the host downloads the operator-pinned prebuilt
 *    release (the module's own verified constant, injected as this module's default). Provenance
 *    `PinnedRelease`. A missing section never fails the run.
 *
 * A custom build for local testing goes through the instruction's `## Preparation` section (step 1)
 * rather than a preloaded-directory channel: `ADGUARD_EXTENSION_PATH` was dropped (27-AFK) because
 * both production callers of `runFixCore` already cleared it before reaching this module, so it was
 * unreachable dead configuration.
 *
 * Contract for every failure: there is NO second attempt — a failed download, digest, unpack, or
 * placement throws the typed error with the full captured output, and the fix run fails named. The
 * pinned release's digest marker is the only retry mechanism, across runs.
