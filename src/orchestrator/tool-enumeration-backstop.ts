/**
 * The enumeration backstop: what catches a model searching by one tool call per candidate.
 *
 * The pathology this exists for is NOT repetition. The first scheduled live pass after the
 * modular-agent merge lost AdguardFilters #242044 (dl.3dmgame.com): the run spent its entire
 * 35-minute investigation budget and sealed `wall_clock_exceeded` without ever reaching
 * `apply_rule` — 227 tool calls over 168 model turns, 99 of them `stabilize_page`, including one
 * uninterrupted run of 37.
 *
 * Those 37 calls were not identical. Each carried a different `targetSelector` (`.GmL_8 >
 * div:nth-of-type(2)`, `div:has(> img[src*="1789529315"])`, `a[href*="steam"]`, …), and 74 distinct
 * results came back across the 99 calls: `stabilize_page` reports `targetFound`, so the model used
 * it to test one candidate selector per call while the page's `networkEntryCount` went on climbing
 * 96 → 297. A guard on repeated ARGUMENTS would have fired zero times on that run — the longest
 * identical-argument streak in the whole trace is 2, and it is a different tool.
 *
 * So the streak counted here is same-tool-regardless-of-arguments, and the notice tells the model
 * to batch what it has left to check. It never says the answer is already in hand: for this run
 * that would have been false, since every call did answer a different question — one model turn,
 * about 13 seconds on this provider, at a time.
 *
 * The two roles are kept apart on purpose. `stabilize_page`'s catalog guidance is what PREVENTS
 * this misuse, by saying what the target parameter is for and where batch selector tests belong.
 * This module is only the backstop for whatever enumerates next, which is why it names no tool and
 * treats every tool alike.

/**
 * Consecutive same-tool calls after which the notice rides along with the real result.
 *
 * Picked from the two bands the incident trace actually shows. The legitimate band reached 9 — nine
 * consecutive `evaluate_js` calls, each a genuinely different DOM probe that no earlier answer
 * could have supplied — while the pathological run was 37. Twelve clears the legitimate band with
 * margin, so an honest investigation never meets this notice, and it still leaves 25 of those 37
 * calls (roughly five minutes of model turns) for the model to change course and finish the run.
