/**
 * The model-facing shape of one `apply_rule` result.
 *
 * The experiment's record is evidence first: three phases with their measurements, the structure
 * facts, and the vision review. On a long page that record outgrows the tool-result limit, and the
 * generic envelope then hands the model the first kilobytes of JSON — which is where the phases
 * live, while the verdict sits at the very end. Live run 35229530522 finished its review for the
 * first time, the result came to 84,098 bytes against the 65,536-byte limit, and the model wrote
 * "apply_rule returned no readable verdict" and gave up on a candidate it could have corrected.
 *
 * So the decision travels first and always: the review, its artifact ids and the summary lead the
 * object, and when the whole still exceeds the budget the bulky evidence is replaced, largest
 * first, by a pointer to the persisted record. Nothing is lost — the full record is an artifact
 * `get_detail` reads — and the run's own bookkeeping keeps reading the unprojected result.
