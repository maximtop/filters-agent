/**
 * The host-performed file-backed application between two environment phases.
 *
 * Decision 3 of 31-AFK: for a file-backed verification there is nothing for a model session to do.
 * The state the read-back credits is a file, and the host is the only party that knows where the
 * run's checkout is, so the host maintains it: write the file (empty for the Baseline goal, exactly
 * the candidate line for the Candidate goal), rebuild the Firefox enterprise policies from the
 * instruction's declaration plus what was just written, relaunch the session — Firefox reads
 * policies only at startup, so a running browser can never pick up new managed storage — and read
 * the file back through the same reader every file-backed verification uses.
 *
 * No prompt, no turn, no model. The credit rules are unchanged and shared with the model-driven
 * path (`blocker-state-credit.ts`): empty content credits the Baseline, the exact candidate content
 * credits the Candidate, and the proof detail names the file the host wrote and the relaunch it
 * performed.
