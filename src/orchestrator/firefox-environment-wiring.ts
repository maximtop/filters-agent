/**
 * What a run hands the Firefox-family filtering environment.
 *
 * The Chromium twin of this module (`buildBrowserExtensionEnvironmentOptions` in
 * `phase-application-launch.ts`) reads an unpacked build's `manifest.json` for its versions and
 * binds an AdGuard settings provider over the launch read-back. A Firefox-family run has neither:
 * its whole executable identity is the launch declaration, so the options are built from that
 * declaration plus the session seams the runtime supplies, and the run's filter baseline is the
 * declaration's list selection rather than anything resolved against AdGuard's catalog (32-AFK
 * Decisions 1 and 3).
