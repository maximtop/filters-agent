/**
 * The run-owned directory the host keeps its own blocker state in.
 *
 * A file-backed verification declares its target as a relative path (`read: managed-storage-file
 * filters-agent/ublock/user-filters.txt`), and that file is the host's state, not repository
 * content: between phases the host writes the candidate rule into it, reads it back, and a Firefox
 * launch carries its current content into managed storage. Resolving such a target against the
 * run's checkout put that file inside the repository, where every later walk of the checkout read
 * the run's own candidate back as repository content — the safety gate's duplicate scan rejected a
 * verified candidate as already present, and the verdict's recomputed hostname baseline drifted
 * away from the hash the apply-time context had recorded (the sarkisozleri.bbs.tr run lost its
 * candidate exactly that way). A directory outside the checkout removes the question by
 * construction: no checkout walk can reach it.
 *
 * Anchored at `os.tmpdir()`, like every other private directory a run creates for itself (browser
 * profiles, the Firefox launch home): it is the one writable place the GitHub container action, the
 * lab runners and a desktop run all agree on, and every run already depends on it for its browser
 * profiles.
