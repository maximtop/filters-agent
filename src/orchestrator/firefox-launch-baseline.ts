/**
 * The launch-time baseline of a Firefox-family run.
 *
 * The Chromium route proves its baseline by pre-reading the AdGuard extension's live state,
 * converging the requested filter set against the build's bundled catalog and crediting the session
 * from a state read-back. A Firefox-family run can do none of that: `moz-extension://` pages cannot
 * be driven, so the blocker's own state is unreadable from the host.
 *
 * Decision 3 of 32-AFK says what readiness means instead: a successful launch with the declared
 * policies applied. The browser has installed the signed XPI and read the managed-storage document
 * at startup by the time the session exists, so the baseline this function credits is the
 * declaration's own list selection — and it says plainly what it could not observe, so nothing
 * downstream mistakes the credit for a live settings proof.
