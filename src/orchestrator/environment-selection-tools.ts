/**
 * The environment-selection model tools: locking exactly one filtering executor for the run when
 * the run's executor set offers a choice, and refining the observed issue type afterwards without
 * disturbing that lock.
 *
 * They register through `EnvironmentSelectionToolsHost` rather than against the runtime class, so
 * the dispatch through the chosen registration's activation can be exercised against a constructed
 * host with fake registrations. The executor set itself is the run's resolved registrations: the
 * description composes their `selectionGuidance`, and an accepted non-reserved selection dispatches
 * through that registration's `activate` — no executor-specific branch lives here.
 *
 * Both tools read their JSON parameters from the shared catalog through `registeredParameters`,
 * which reaches their strict `FIX_TOOL_PARAMETER_SCHEMAS` shapes through
 * `REGISTERED_SHAPE_OVERRIDES` — `update_observed_intent` has no `TOOL_PARAMETER_SCHEMAS` entry,
 * and `select_environment`'s entry there is the widened gate stub whose every property is optional.
 * Nothing advertises the registry `parameters` (the session adapter advertises the catalog schema
 * itself and the drift guard is its only reader), so deriving both from one schema makes them agree
 * by construction.
