/**
 * The file-backed arm of the between-phases application flow, and the projection both arms map
 * their result through.
 *
 * Decision 3 of 31-AFK: when the run's prepared build is a Firefox-family one, the application is
 * the host's own work — it writes the declared file, rebuilds the enterprise policies, relaunches
 * the session and reads the file back (`file-backed-application.ts`). No model session runs, so
 * none of the AdGuard route's session pieces (the options-page surface, the settings payload, the
 * live-extension read) are built for it. This module is that arm plus the one mapping from an
 * application result onto the environment's configuration seam, shared with the model-driven arm in
 * `phase-application-flow.ts`.

 * @param host - The runtime seam this flow acts through, supplying the relaunch.
 * @param state - Prepared active session naming this run's Firefox launch declaration.
 * @param request - Application inputs: phase, target, instruction, and the caller's cancellation.
 * @param goal - The expected blocker state the host read-back is credited against.
 * @param session - The established phase session the relaunch replaces.
 * @param method - The declared verification method.
 * @param targetPath - Absolute declared file path, already resolved and contained, or null when the
