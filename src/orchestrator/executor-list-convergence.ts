 * nothing worse than reporter-enabled third-party list 207 (Adblock Warning Removal List).
 *
 * Asking for filters and converging on none is still a refusal: a baseline with no list to execute
 * measures nothing, so the run says so instead of silently proving a rule against an empty filter
 * set. An empty request is not that case — an instruction-declared launch requests no official list
 * at all, because its own declaration is the baseline — so it passes through untouched.
