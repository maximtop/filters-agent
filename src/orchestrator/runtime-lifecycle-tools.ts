/**
 * The issue and browser lifecycle tools the agent runtime owns: `fetch_issue`, the runtime's own
 * wrappers over the base registry's guidance and screenshot tools, full-page capture inspection,
 * and the `launch_browser` / `close_browser` session lifecycle. The run's extension build is
 * prepared host-side before the session, so no preparation tool exists here.
 *
 * They register through {@link RuntimeLifecycleToolsHost} rather than against the runtime class, so
 * each handler's bookkeeping is one named seam instead of a reach into runtime state. The
 * reporter-aware `analyze_screenshot` variant is one tool rather than a lifecycle concern and lives
 * beside the plain one in `src/agent/reporter-screenshot-tool.ts`; this file only adapts the host
 * for it.
 *
 * Every one of them reads its registered JSON parameters from the shared catalog through
 * `registeredParameters`, so the catalog stays their single declaration. `close_browser` has no
 * `TOOL_PARAMETER_SCHEMAS` entry at all, so it resolves through a `REGISTERED_SHAPE_OVERRIDES`
 * entry onto its strict `FIX_TOOL_PARAMETER_SCHEMAS` mirror — the same shape the fix session
 * already advertises. `launch_browser` is the one per-run shape: the host hands it the run's
 * advertisement, because whether the request carries `settings` depends on the family of the
 * blocker this run prepared. Nothing advertises the registry `parameters` itself; the drift guard
 * is its only reader, so deriving both sides from one schema makes them agree by construction.
