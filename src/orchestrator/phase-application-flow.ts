/**
 * The between-phases application procedure: bring the blocker to the prepared state over a lease
 * session, then read the blocker state back and map the result onto the adapter's configuration
 * seam.
 *
 * Who performs the steps follows the run's application route, never the blocker's name: the
 * built-in AdGuard route (a run with no instruction, or one declaring `application:
 * adguard-extension`) is performed by the host itself in code (`host-extension-application.ts`),
 * while an instruction that writes its own `## Rule application` gets the bounded model session
 * (`application-session.ts`) — other blockers have their own simple way to add a rule and the model
 * uses the one the instruction wrote. Both decisions come out of one resolution,
 * `phase-application-flow-host.ts`'s `hostPerformsApplication`, which the document fill
 * `applicationInstructionContent` is derived from too, so the contract in force and its performer
 * can never disagree.
 *
 * This module owns the flow `agent-runtime.ts` used to run inline (`runApplication` through the
 * runner and read-back helpers it composes): the same operations, now taking their runtime
 * dependencies as an explicit host object instead of `this`, so the flow is callable — and testable
 * — without the whole runtime class. `phase-application-flow-host.ts` declares the host and
 * dependency contracts this flow acts through and the shape one application call returns;
 * `phase-application-extension-surface.ts` owns the host's own dealings with the prepared
 * extension's management surface. `phase-application-launch.ts` builds on this module for the
 * launch-time Baseline application; none of these modules imports `agent-runtime.ts`, so the
 * dependency runs one way only.
