/**
 * The host's own dealings with the prepared extension's management surface, for one application.
 *
 * Three host-side operations bracket every AdGuard-route application: locating the prepared build's
 * options page, reading the settings export over it to build the import payload, and reading the
 * complete extension state back afterwards. None of them may touch the phase session's own page —
 * the lease observes the reported target there — so each opens a throwaway page on the surface
 * instead and closes it whether the work succeeded or threw.
 *
 * `phase-application-flow.ts` composes these around the application runner; the host-performed
 * runner (`host-extension-application.ts`) drives the protocol over the same dedicated-page
 * helper.
