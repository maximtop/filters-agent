/**

 * pre-orchestrated fix session; the noun naming what it was waiting for is still a named parameter
 * rather than a hardcoded string, so a future mode that seals the same way needs no change here.
 *
 * It lives here rather than beside the seal mapping in `src/tracer/session-trace.ts` because the
 * value it builds is a `FixOutcome`, and the tracer must not depend on the PR layer.
