 * behaviour for that role. The application contract was the one exception: as soon as an
 * instruction existed it replaced the built-in application document wholesale, so an instruction
 * written only to link its repository's guidance documents lost the contract entirely. The early
 * file-backed gate cannot catch that (there is no contract to inspect), so the run spent its whole
 * budget and `apply_rule` then refused with `no-application-method`.
 *
 * The declaration is one line, in the same shape as the `read:`, `launch:` and `placement:`
 * declarations: `application: <route>`.
