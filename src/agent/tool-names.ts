/**
 * The agent tool vocabulary: every tool name this app registers, advertises, gates, or quarantines.
 *
 * A tool name is a domain concept, not an incidental string: it keys the guidance map, the
 * advertisement schema maps, the frozen fix surface, the gate-refusing stub tables, and the
 * diagnostic quarantine rules. Declaring it once here means a new tool is spelled in exactly one
 * place and a typo at any call site is a compile error rather than a silently inert table entry.
 *
 * This module deliberately imports nothing, so every layer — catalog, factory, orchestrator
 * sessions — can depend on it without creating a cycle.
