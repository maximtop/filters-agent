/**
 * PreparedExtension — the host-validated extension build every fix run carries into its browser
 * sessions, and the provenance vocabulary that replaces the build-from-source cache record at the
 * runtime seam.
 *
 * Exactly ONE PreparedExtension exists per run, prepared before the fix session starts: the host
 * downloads the operator-pinned prebuilt release, or adopts what the short-lived preparation
 * session built from the instruction's `## Preparation` section. The source kind is recorded so run
 * records state where the loaded build came from; the digest pins the exact source bytes and makes
 * substitution detectable. (A third source, an operator-preloaded directory, was dropped in 27-AFK;
 * `PreparedExtensionSource.Preloaded` stays parseable for run records persisted before the drop.)
 *
 * Decision 1 of 31-AFK: the record carries its launch family, because the two families install
 * through channels with nothing in common — a Chromium unpacked directory, or a Firefox signed XPI
 * force-installed through enterprise policies whose managed storage carries the user filters.
