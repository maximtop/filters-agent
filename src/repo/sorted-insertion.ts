 * Where a rule belongs inside a list file that keeps its rules sorted.

 * `FOP.py` over its lists and its contributing guide asks for "the correct position following ASCII
 * ascending sorting", so a rule appended after the last line arrives out of place and a maintainer
 * has to move it. A live run against the EasyList fork proposed exactly that — the verified rule
 * was planned `append_eof` into `easylist/easylist_specific_hide.txt`, whose selector order is
 * intact over 99.6% of adjacent lines.
 *
 * Sortedness is measured rather than assumed: the same measurement over AdguardFilters
 * `BaseFilter/sections/specific.txt` (0.519) and uAssets `filters/filters-2026.txt` (0.522) shows
 * those files are chronological logs, where the sorted position would be meaningless and the
 * existing domain-block and end-of-file anchors stay right.
