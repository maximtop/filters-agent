 * header/URL/JWT half — which meant every new exemption had to be taught twice and one pass could
 * scrub what the other preserved.
 *
 * One table, two scopes: {@link RedactionScope} says whether a pass is writing an artifact to disk
 * or answering the model mid-run, and the rules that rewrite PAGE-AUTHORED text rather than
 * credentials — the header-line rule and the URL rule — apply only to the former. See the scope's
 * own note for why.

/**
 * What a redaction pass is producing, which decides how aggressively page-authored text may be
 * rewritten.
 *
 * Both scopes scrub every credential form: a whole value that IS a credential, a JWT anywhere in
 * the text, a token prefix, and the exact host secrets. They differ on two rules that match on
 * SHAPE rather than on secrecy, and that therefore also match evidence:
 *
 * - The header-line rule blanks any line whose first token is `cookie`/`authorization`/`api-key`
 *   followed by `:` or `=` — including a consent banner's DOM line `Cookie: settings`; and
 * - The URL rule scrubs `key`/`session`/`sid`/`auth`/`token` query values out of any URL, whether the
 *   URL is the whole value or quoted inside free text — including the reporter's URL in the issue
 *   body the agent is investigating.
 *
 * In a persisted artifact that trade is right: the artifact leaves the machine, and a blanked
 * consent line costs nothing once the run is over. In a tool result answering the model mid-run it
 * is not: those bytes ARE the investigation — the DOM line the selector is derived from, the URL
 * whose parameters the report is about — and a model that cannot see them cannot find the defect.
 * The URL rule is skipped whole rather than only for embedded URLs so the model never sees the same
 * URL two ways: `fetch_issue`'s `url` field and the copy of it quoted in the issue body are the
 * same string, and a model comparing them must not be told they differ.
