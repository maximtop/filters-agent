/**
 * The executable filter baseline a run declares instead of resolving.
 *
 * Decision 1 of 32-AFK: for a Firefox-family preparation nothing is resolved against AdGuard's
 * official catalog. The run's executable baseline is the list selection of the instruction's own
 * managed-storage declaration — the `selectedFilterLists` the blocker reads at startup, plus the
 * user-filters pseudo-list the candidate rule is applied through — and the reporter's own filter
 * names are compared against that selection for the report only.
 *
 * The two names this module knows (`selectedFilterLists`, `user-filters`) are the uBlock Origin
 * managed-storage convention the decision names verbatim; the rest of the template's shape stays
 * the instruction's own business. The lookup is keyed off the declared user-filters key path rather
 * than a hardcoded `adminSettings`, so an instruction that nests its settings elsewhere still
 * resolves.
