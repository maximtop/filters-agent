/**
 * The filtering environment of a Firefox-family blocker: uBlock Origin force-installed from a
 * signed XPI, running the list selection its instruction declares.
 *
 * Decision 3 of 32-AFK — one adapter per family. The Chromium/AdGuard adapter locks an unpacked
 * build's `manifest.json` and its `ruleset_<id>` bytes, re-locks them before every phase, and
 * credits itself from the AdGuard extension's own live settings. A signed XPI has none of those: no
 * unpacked root, no readable manifest generation, and no `moz-extension://` page the host may
 * drive. So this adapter's readiness is a successful launch with the declared policies applied, and
 * its phases are:
 *
 * - **A** — Firefox with no extension at all.
 * - **B** — Firefox with the XPI force-installed, the declaration's lists, and an empty user-filters
 *   file.
 * - **C** — the same, plus exactly the candidate line.
 *
 * B and C are reached through the host-side file application the configuration seam performs
 * (31-AFK Decision 3): write the declared file, rebuild the enterprise policies, relaunch — Firefox
 * reads `policies.json` only at startup — and read the file back. The phase proof records that
 * read-back; this adapter never judges it a second time. The one thing it adds is the enabled set:
 * a file read-back cannot see it, and Decision 2 says the proof carries the template's list keys,
 * observed from the declaration rather than guessed or reported as unobserved.
