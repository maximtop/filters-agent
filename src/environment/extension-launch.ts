 * install an extension through channels that have nothing in common. A Chromium-family build is an
 * unpacked directory the engine loads directly; a Firefox-family build is a signed XPI
 * force-installed through enterprise policies, whose managed storage carries the user filters. The
 * engine, the user-agent family and the between-phases application all follow this descriptor, so
 * it is declared once here — a path-free vocabulary both the Host layer and the model boundary
 * depend on, importing nothing but the manifest-generation vocabulary beside it.
