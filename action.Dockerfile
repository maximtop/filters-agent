# The container action image of the `filters-agent` action face: the sources, node_modules and
# both browsers in one image, booted through tsx — the same mechanism as `pnpm start` on a
# developer machine. There is no build step and no bundle; the repository ships sources, so a
# `src/` change is an image change by construction. The browser presence check
# (`src/action/action-main.ts`) never downloads: everything it probes is installed here, and the
# final proof of each browser is a real headless launch at build time — a launched browser is the
# capability, its installed files are not (`ldd` and directory listings assert prerequisites,
# not the capability).

# The run-time vocabulary of the action face: `CLOAKBROWSER_AUTO_UPDATE=false` turns the browser
# presence check (`src/action/action-main.ts`) into a named failure instead of a silent download;
# the headless/no-sandbox pair matches the config's own semantics (`NO_SANDBOX` is read there, and
# container runs execute as root); both browser caches resolve against image-owned directories, so
# no launch ever looks at a user home.

# Every run clones or fetches the filters checkout through this git, and the pinned extension
# release unpacks through unzip; `safe.directory` covers the mounted checkout, which belongs to

# capability, not by installation: git writes a real archive and unzip must decompress and
# CRC-check it, so a broken tool fails the build instead of the first run. `git archive
# --format=zip` uses git's built-in zip writer, so no `zip` package is added.

# where the binding (`src/action/action-input-binding.ts`) fails named from `/app`, and a bound but
